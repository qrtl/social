This module allows adding domains to the mail domain blacklist to prevent Odoo from assuming  
that users with the same domain belong to the same organization.

Due to the nature of this module, in a multi-tenant setting, the configuration in one database
affects all databases in the Odoo instance.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Odoo can't add certain domains to the _MAIL_DOMAIN_BLACKLIST, which can result in incorrectly  
assuming that users with one of these specific domains belong to the same organization.  

For example, since outlook.jp is not part of _MAIL_DOMAIN_BLACKLIST, when partners have this  
same domain and create helpdesk tickets, they may end up sharing partners and mistakenly  
assuming ownership of each other's tickets.

Configuration
=============

1. Go to Settings > General Settings.  
2. Search for "Mail Domain Blacklist" and enter the domains you want to blacklist, separated  
   by commas.  

Note: Every time you update the "Mail Domain Blacklist," you need to restart the Odoo server
for the change to take effect.
